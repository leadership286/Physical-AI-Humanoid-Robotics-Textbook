# Feature Specification: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course Book with Docusaurus

**Feature Branch**: `1-docusaurus-book`
**Created**: 2025-12-04
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "You are helping me create a detailed specification for a Spec-Kit Plus project for a book titled "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course".

Requirements:

1. The book will be implemented using Docusaurus.

2. We already have 5 chapters generated by Claude, named:

  - Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI

  - Chapter 2: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

  - Chapter 3: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

  - Chapter 4: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

  - Chapter 5: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

3. The specification should:

  - Include project metadata (title, description, author)

  - Define chapters in order

  - Specify that each chapter is a Markdown file inside `docs/` folder

  - Include sidebar configuration for Docusaurus navigation

  - Include placeholder for future chapters (Chapter 6 onward)

  - Include deployment instructions (GitHub Pages)

  - Include notes for integrating Claude/Gemini AI for generating additional chapters

4. Output should be in Spec-Kit specification format ready to run with `/sp.specify`

5. Be detailed, structured, and complete — do not skip any part.

Generate the specification so that the project can:

- Recognize existing 5 chapters

- Automatically set up Docusaurus documentation site structure

- Be ready for adding more chapters later"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Browse Book Chapters (Priority: P1)

Users can navigate through the existing chapters of the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course" book, exploring content generated by Claude.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality, allowing readers to access the book's content. Without this, the book is unusable.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by deploying the Docusaurus site and verifying that all 5 existing chapters are accessible and navigable via the sidebar and next/previous controls.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** a user is on the book's homepage, **When** they click on a chapter title in the sidebar, **Then** the content of that specific chapter is displayed in the main content area.
2.  **Given** a user is viewing any chapter, **When** they click on the "Next Chapter" or "Previous Chapter" navigation links, **Then** they are successfully navigated to the adjacent chapter in the defined sequence.
3.  **Given** a user accesses the Docusaurus site, **When** they inspect the page metadata, **Then** they see the correct book title, description, and author.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a chapter markdown file is missing? The Docusaurus build process should ideally report a clear error, and the navigation should not include the missing chapter.
- How does the system handle very long chapter titles or a large number of chapters in the sidebar? Docusaurus should handle responsive display and scrolling appropriately.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

-   **FR-001**: The book content MUST be structured and implemented using the Docusaurus framework.
-   **FR-002**: The Docusaurus project MUST include project-level metadata, specifically the book's title ("Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course"), a concise description, and the author (Claude Code).
-   **FR-003**: The project MUST define and order the initial five existing chapters as follows:
    -   Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI
    -   Chapter 2: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
    -   Chapter 3: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
    -   Chapter 4: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
    -   Chapter 5: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
-   **FR-004**: Each chapter's content MUST reside in a dedicated Markdown file (`.md` extension) within the `docs/` folder of the Docusaurus project structure.
-   **FR-005**: The Docusaurus site MUST implement a navigation sidebar that prominently displays all defined chapters in their specified order, allowing users to easily browse.
-   **FR-006**: The Docusaurus configuration MUST include a clear placeholder or mechanism for seamlessly integrating and displaying future chapters (Chapter 6 onward) into the sidebar and navigation flow.
-   **FR-007**: The project documentation MUST include detailed, step-by-step instructions for deploying the Docusaurus site to GitHub Pages, ensuring public accessibility.
-   **FR-008**: The project documentation MUST include specific notes and guidelines on how to integrate and utilize Claude/Gemini AI models for generating additional book chapters, specifying expected input/output formats or relevant tooling.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

-   **Chapter**: A fundamental unit of the book, represented by a Markdown file. Each chapter has a unique identifier (e.g., "chapter-1"), a display title, and content. Chapters are ordered sequentially to form the book's narrative.
-   **Docusaurus Site**: The web application generated by Docusaurus, hosting the book content, navigation, and metadata.
-   **Sidebar**: The primary navigation component in the Docusaurus site, listing chapters and allowing direct access.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

-   **SC-001**: The Docusaurus documentation site is successfully built and deployed to GitHub Pages, resulting in a publicly accessible URL within 10 minutes of deployment initiation.
-   **SC-002**: All five initial chapters are correctly rendered and fully navigable within the deployed Docusaurus site, with no broken links or missing content, achieving 100% content availability for defined chapters.
-   **SC-003**: The navigation sidebar accurately displays all defined chapters in the specified sequence, and clicking any chapter title navigates to its corresponding content in less than 500ms.
-   **SC-004**: The project structure allows for the addition of new chapters (Chapter 6 onwards) by simply adding new Markdown files to `docs/` and updating the sidebar configuration with a success rate of 95% for automated build processes incorporating new chapters.
-   **SC-005**: The deployment instructions (FR-007) and AI integration notes (FR-008) are clear, comprehensive, and enable a user to successfully deploy the site and understand AI integration concepts without further clarification.
